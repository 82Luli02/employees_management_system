### Project Title
EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

### Description
This program made to save a list of employees records and then perform several operations on this list.
The program will ask the user to choose the option from a menu.

The 6 major function in menu are:
- INSERT EMPLOYMENT
- DISPLAY ALL EMPLOYMENTS
- FIND EMPLOYMENT INFO ID
- SEARCH HIGHEST SALARY
- DELETE EMPLOYMENT ID
- REVERSE DISPLAY ALL EMPLOYMENTS
- Exit


### Aim
The primary aim of this program is to implement a linked list and to practice recursion for a real-world problem.


### Implementation
The menu is handled by do while and switch statement.
The Methods to be implemented are as follows:

1. INSERT EMPLOYMENT

This method will add a new employee to the list.
It takes 3 parameters (employee name, id, and salary).

2. DISPLAY ALL EMPLOYMENTS

This method will display all the employee records.

3. FIND EMPLOYMENT INFO ID

This method will search for an employee with his/her id.
If the employee is found it will print her/his record to the output.
If the employee is not found it will print “There is no record of this employee in
this system”

4. DELETE EMPLOYMENT id

This method will be followed by an integer id. To implement this method, you
have to iterate over the linked list of employees you created and delete the
employee (node). If the employee is not found, the method will print “There is no
employee with the id "#######" in the system.”.

5. SEARCH HIGHEST SALARY

This method will print the information of the employee with the highest salary.

6. REVERSE DISPLAY ALL EMPLOYMENTS

This method will print all the employee records in this system in reverse order. you
should implement this method using recursion.
